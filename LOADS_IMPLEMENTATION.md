# Loads Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Loads Management system with multi-step wizard forms and file upload functionality.

## What Was Created

### 1. Load Entity (`src/entities/load/`)
- **types.ts** - TypeScript interfaces for Load, CreateLoadDto, and UpdateLoadDto
- **api.ts** - API client functions (getAll, getById, create, update, delete)
- **index.ts** - Barrel exports

### 2. File Upload Utility (`src/shared/api/fileApi.ts`)
Complete file management system with:
- `requestUploadUrl()` - Get presigned S3 upload URL
- `uploadToS3()` - Upload file directly to S3
- `uploadFile()` - Complete upload flow (request URL + upload)
- `getDownloadUrl()` - Get presigned download URL
- `deleteFile()` - Delete file from S3
- `downloadFile()` - Download file to browser

### 3. Load Management Features (`src/features/load-management/`)

#### **LoadCreateModal.tsx**
Multi-step wizard with 7 steps:
1. Customer Information (customer, reference number, customer rate, contact name)
2. Carrier Information (carrier, payment method, carrier rate)
3. Service Information (service fee toggle, load type, service type, service given as, commodity)
4. Booking Information (booked as, sold as, weight, temperature)
5. Pick-up Location (city/zip, phone, carrier, name, address)
6. Drop-off Location (city/zip, phone, carrier, name, address)
7. Files (multiple file uploads with S3 integration)

Features:
- Step-by-step validation
- Next/Previous navigation
- Form state persistence across steps
- Multiple file upload support
- Real-time file upload to S3

#### **LoadEditModal.tsx**
Same multi-step wizard as create, but:
- Loads existing load data
- Pre-fills all form fields
- Shows existing uploaded files
- Allows adding/removing files

#### **LoadManagementTable.tsx**
Comprehensive table with:
- Display all loads with key information
- Search functionality (customer, reference, contact, carrier, commodity)
- Sortable columns
- Actions: Edit and Delete
- File count indicator
- Responsive design with horizontal scroll
- Pagination with customizable page size

### 4. Updated LoadsPage (`src/pages/LoadsPage.tsx`)
- Integrated LoadManagementTable
- Clean layout with Ant Design components

## Data Structure

### Load Fields (30+ fields organized in 7 sections):

**Customer Information:**
- customer* (required)
- referenceNumber* (required)
- customerRate (optional)
- contactName* (required)

**Carrier Information:**
- carrier (optional)
- carrierPaymentMethod (optional)
- carrierRate* (required)

**Service Information:**
- chargeServiceFeeToOffice (boolean)
- loadType* (required)
- serviceType* (required)
- serviceGivenAs* (required)
- commodity* (required)

**Booking Information:**
- bookedAs* (required)
- soldAs* (required)
- weight* (required)
- temperature (optional)

**Pick-up Location:**
- pickupCityZipcode (optional)
- pickupPhoneNumber (optional)
- pickupSelectCarrier* (required)
- pickupName* (required)
- pickupAddress* (required)

**Drop-off Location:**
- dropoffCityZipcode (optional)
- dropoffPhoneNumber (optional)
- dropoffSelectCarrier* (required)
- dropoffName* (required)
- dropoffAddress* (required)

**Additional Fields:**
- fileIds[] (array of file IDs from S3)

## API Integration

### Load Endpoints
- `GET /loads` - Get all loads
- `GET /loads/:id` - Get load by ID
- `POST /loads` - Create new load
- `PATCH /loads/:id` - Update load
- `DELETE /loads/:id` - Delete load

### File Endpoints
- `POST /files` - Request upload URL
- `GET /files/:fileId` - Get download URL
- `DELETE /files/:fileId` - Delete file

## Features Implemented

✅ Multi-step wizard form (7 steps)
✅ Form validation at each step
✅ Multiple file uploads to S3
✅ File management (upload, download, delete)
✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✅ Search and filter functionality
✅ Responsive table with pagination
✅ Error handling and user feedback
✅ Loading states
✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

As discussed, the following can be adjusted later:
1. Convert text fields to dropdowns for:
   - Customer (from existing customers)
   - Carrier (from existing carriers)
   - Load Type, Service Type, Service Given As, Commodity (predefined options)
   - Booked As, Sold As (predefined options)

2. Add autocomplete functionality for location fields

3. Add file preview functionality

4. Add bulk operations (bulk delete, export to CSV/Excel)

5. Add advanced filters and sorting

6. Add load status tracking (pending, in-transit, delivered, etc.)

## Notes
- All files are properly typed with TypeScript
- No linter errors
- Follows existing project patterns (similar to user-management and branch-management)
- Uses Ant Design components consistently
- Proper error handling and user feedback
